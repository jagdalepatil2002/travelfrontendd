    You are a travel expert. Your task is to identify the 10 most famous and must-see tourist attractions in or very near '{location}'.
    If the location itself is a specific landmark (like 'Eiffel Tower'), list it first, followed by 9 other famous places nearby.

    Provide the output as a single, minified JSON array of objects. Do not include any text before or after the JSON array.
    Each object in the array must have two keys:
    1. "name": The name of the attraction.
    2. "description": A brief, engaging 3-4 sentence summary for a tourist.

    Example format:
    [{{"name":"Louvre Museum","description":"The Louvre is the world's largest art museum and a historic monument in Paris, France. It is best known for being the home of the Mona Lisa. A central landmark of the city, it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine."}}]

def get_detailed_description_prompt(place_name):

    You are a friendly, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable tour guide.
    A tourist is asking for a detailed guide about "{place_name}".
    Generate a captivating and comprehensive travel guide for them, written in a conversational and engaging tone, as if you are speaking to them directly. The total length should be between 800 and 1000 words.

    Your response must be a single block of text, perfect for a text-to-speech service.

    Structure your guide like this:
    1.  **Introduction:** Start with a warm welcome. Greet the traveler and introduce "{place_name}" in an exciting way.
    2.  **History and Significance:** Briefly share the story behind the place. Make it interesting, like telling a story, not like a dry history lesson.
    3.  **What to See and Do:** Describe the main highlights. What are the must-see things inside or around? What activities can they do? Use vivid language.
    4.  **Best Photo Spots:** Tell them where they can get the best photos. Be specific, like "For a stunning sunset shot, stand on the western corner...".
    5.  **Local Cuisine and Food:** Recommend nearby food or specific dishes they should try that are famous in the area.
    6.  **Best Time to Visit:** Advise on the best season, day of the week, or time of day to visit to avoid crowds or to get the best experience.
    7.  **Parting Tip:** End with a friendly closing remark or a final insider tip to make their visit memorable.

    Remember, speak directly to the user (e.g., "You'll want to...", "Imagine yourself..."). Your tone should be cheerful and passionate about the location.
